# shoutout [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/DouweM/shoutout.png?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/DouweM/shoutout)

A Ruby library for easily getting metadata from Shoutcast-compatible audio streaming servers.

## Installation

Use the original gem like this:
```sh
gem install shoutout
```

Or use mine, with better thread-safe and encoding in your Gemfile:

```ruby
gem "shoutout", github: "dirble/shoutout"
```

## Usage

```ruby
require "shoutout"

# You can open a connection to the stream that will live for the duration of the block using `.open`:
Shoutout::Stream.open("http://82.201.100.5:8000/radio538") do |stream|
  # Use `stream` as described below.
end

# If you want a little more control over opening and closing the connection, just use `.new`: 
stream = Shoutout::Stream.new("http://82.201.100.5:8000/radio538")

# You can then explicitly open a connection to the stream. 
# You're responsible for closing it using `#disconnect` when you're done.
stream.connect

# If you call any of the reader methods below without having opened a connection using `#connect` 
# or `.open`, one will be opened and closed around reading the information implicitly.
# This is convenient if you're only looking for one piece of information, but it is of course 
# very inefficient if you're going to do multiple reads.

# Stream info
stream.name         # => "RADIO538" 
stream.description  # => "ARE YOU IN"
stream.genre        # => "Various"
stream.notice       # => nil in this case, but this could very well have a value for your stream
stream.content_type # => "audio/mpeg"
stream.bitrate      # => 128
stream.public?      # => true
stream.audio_info   # => { :samplerate => 44100, :bitrate => 128, :channels => 2 }

# Current metadata
stream.metadata # => { "StreamTitle" => "Armin van Buuren - This Is What It Feels Like", "StreamUrl" => "http://www.radio538.nl" }

# The Metadata object is a Hash that has been extended with the following features:
stream.metadata[:stream_title]  # => "Armin van Buuren - This Is What It Feels Like"
stream.metadata[:stream_url]    # => "http://www.radio538.nl"
stream.metadata.now_playing     # => "Armin van Buuren - This Is What It Feels Like"
stream.metadata.website         # => "http://www.radio538.nl"
stream.metadata.artist          # => "Armin van Buuren"
stream.metadata.song            # => "This Is What It Feels Like"

# Conveniently, `#now_playing` and `#website` are also available on the stream object:
stream.now_playing  # => "Armin van Buuren - This Is What It Feels Like"
stream.website      # => "http://www.radio538.nl"

# For convenience, all of the reader methods above are also available as class methods:
Shoutout::Stream.now_playing("http://82.201.100.5:8000/radio538") # => "Armin van Buuren - This Is What It Feels Like"
# Just like the equivalent `Shoutout::Stream.new("http://82.201.100.5:8000/radio538").now_playing`,
# this will automatically open and close a connection around reading the information.

# You can be notified every time the metadata changes:
stream.metadata_change do |metadata|
  puts "Now playing: #{metadata.song} by #{metadata.artist}"
  # => Now playing: This Is What It Feels Like by Armin van Buuren
end
# Of course, this only works with an explicitly opened connection.

# If you're done setting up but want the program to keep listening for metadata, say so:
stream.listen
# Note that listening will only end when the connection is lost or the end of file is reached, 
# so anything that comes after this call will only then be executed. 
# This will generally be the last call in your program.

# If we don't want to wait around and listen, just let the program exit or disconnect explicitly:
stream.disconnect
```
